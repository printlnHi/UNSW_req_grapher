{"credit_points":"6","description":"<p>The goal of this course is to deepen students&#39; understanding of data structures and algorithms and how these can be employed effectively in the design of software systems. We anticipate that it will generally be taken in the second year of a program, but since its only pre-requisite is COMP1511, is it possible to take it in first year. It is an important course in covering a range of core data structures and algorithms that will be used in context in later courses.</p>\n<p><strong>Topics:</strong><br /> An introduction the structure, analysis and usage of a range of fundamental data types and the core algorithms that operate on them, including: algorithm analysis, sorting, searching, trees, graphs, files, algorithmic strategies, analysis and measurement of programs. Labs and programming assignments in C, using a range of Unix tools.</p>","duration_ft_std":"","duration_pt_std":"","enrolment_patterns":[],"entry_requirements_transnational":"","generic_course":"false","handbook_link":"","internet_availability":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"text"},"next_internal_review_date":"","owning_org":{"value":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","cl_id":"1a3a1d4f4f4d97404aa6eb4f0310c780","key":"name"},"policy_exemption_s":[],"publish_tuition_fees":"true","short_title":"","start_date":"","supp_exams_permitted":"true","version_approved":"","cs_tags":[],"duration_ft_max":"","duration_pt_max":"","d_gov_cohort_year":"false","enrolment_pattern_details":"","en_lang_requirements":{"value":"","cl_id":"919c14094fb987409e2bfd501310c744","key":"text"},"generic_flag":"false","implementation_month":{"label":"January","value":"1"},"int_avail_clarification":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"text"},"nickname":"","parent_academic_org":{"value":"Faculty of Engineering","cl_id":"5fa56ceb4f0093004aa6eb4f0310c7af","key":"name"},"professional_accreditation":null,"quota":"","sms_status":{"label":null,"value":null},"student_types":[],"cl_id":"28737896db23af00038cc4048a9619b5","asced_code":{"label":null,"value":null},"date_of_last_accreditation":"","duration_ft_min":"","duration_pt_min":"","end_date":"","enrol_restrict":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"text"},"faculty":{"label":null,"value":null},"graduate":"true","implementation_year":"2019","keywords":"Computer Science,  programming,  computing,  data structures,  complexity","no_enrolment":"false","partner_academic_orgs":[],"professional_recognition":null,"quota_rationale":"","sms_version":"","study_level":[{"label":"Undergraduate","value":"ugrd"}],"type":{"label":null,"value":null},"asced_code_narrow":{"label":null,"value":null},"deleted_on":"","duration_ft_period":{"label":null,"value":null},"duration_pt_period":{"label":null,"value":null},"enrolled_credit_points":"","entry_requirements_onshore":"","field_of_education":[],"handbook_code":"","inherent_requirements":"","name":"Data Structures and Algorithms","other_information":"","partner_external_orgs_text":"","published_in_handbook":{"label":"Yes","value":"1"},"research_areas":[],"special_requirements":"","subclass":{"label":null,"value":null},"uac_code":"","assessment":null,"abbr_name":"","base_code":"","content":null,"exclusions":"","learning_experiences":null,"other_learning_experiences":null,"placement_proportion":{"label":null,"value":null},"school":{"label":null,"value":null},"version":"6","base_master":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"","type":null},"delivery_method":{"label":"Fully on-site","value":"Fully on-site"},"flag_for_timetable":"true","learning_materials":null,"other_notes":null,"pre_requisites":"","special_topic":"false","base_version":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"code"},"duration":"","grading_schema":{"label":null,"value":null},"level":{"label":null,"value":null},"overview":"","quota_enrolment_requirements":"","special_unit_type":[],"contact_hours":"7","eftsl":"","learning_and_teaching_resources":null,"other_learning_activities":"","partner_faculty_list":[],"repeatable":"false","standard_handbook_text":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"text"},"academic_org":{"value":"School of Computer Science and Engineering","cl_id":"1a3a1d4f4f4d97404aa6eb4f0310c780","key":"name"},"additional_progression_requirements_rest":"","aqf_level":{"label":null,"value":null},"asced_detailed":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"display_value"},"callista_version":"","accreditation_cycle_frequency":"","admission_cohort":"","areas_of_employment":[],"asced_narrow":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":"display_value"},"code":"COMP2521","accrediting_bodies":[],"aim":"","areas_of_employment_handbook":"","baseline":"false","additional_information":[{"value":"General Education","cl_id":"e5a5a8004fb11700eeb3eb4f0310c716","key":"name"}],"apply_online":{"label":"No","value":"no"},"asced_broad":{"value":"02 Information Technology","cl_id":"cd74ce13db96df002e4c126b3a96194f","key":"display_value"},"broad_type":{"label":null,"value":null},"active":"true","parent_id":{"value":"Master Record: 065183","cl_id":"465733badb0f1380038cc4048a96193f","key":"code","type":"x_f5sl_cl_master_record"},"source":{"value":"","cl_id":null,"key":""},"timetabled_activities":[],"class_name":"Subject","parent_table":"x_f5sl_cl_master_record","status":{"label":"Approved","value":"Active"},"unit_category":{"label":null,"value":null},"effective_date":"2019-01-01","work_integrated_learning":[],"ext_id":"065183","links":[]}
